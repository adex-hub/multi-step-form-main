## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- Complete each step of the sequence ‚úÖ
- See a summary of their selections on the final step and confirm their order ‚úÖ
- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size ‚ùå (not yet!)
- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page ‚úÖ(may not be completely done with this!)

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid (may or may not use this in the mobile development)
- SASS
- Vanilla JS üç¶

### What I learned

I actually just completed my `JavaScript 2023: Zero to Mastery Course` and I was looking for the perfect project to practice on, and this turned out to be the perfect one. I really like this function which was very useful in my being able to implement the slider in the multi-step form.

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```js
function goToSlide(slide) {
  slides.forEach((s, i) => {
    s.style.transform = `translateX(${100 * (i - slide)}%)`;
    s.classList.remove("active-slide");

    if (s.style.transform === `translateX(0%)`) {
      s.classList.add("active-slide");
      if (s.classList.contains("active-slide")) {
        s.querySelector("form")?.insertAdjacentHTML(
          "beforeend",
          `
      <div class="lower-btns" id="lower-btns">
        <a href="#" onClick = "prevSlide()">Go Back</a>
        <button type="submit">Next Step</button>
        </div>
        `
        );
      }
    }
  });
}

```

### Continued development

In future projects I want to work more with APIs, improve my algorithm scripting and learn frameworks like React ‚öõÔ∏è && Vue ‚úåüèø
